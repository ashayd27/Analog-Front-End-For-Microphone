# Active Notch Filter â€“ Signal Suppression at 50 Hz

This subproject demonstrates a **passive band-reject (notch) filter** designed to suppress a 50 Hz component from a composite input signal. The system is implemented in LTSpice using op-amp-based filter blocks and verified through FFT analysis and waveform inspection.

## ðŸ”§ Filter Design Overview

- The **input** signal is a sum of **three sine waves**:
  - `17 V / 124 Hz`
  - `23 V / 83 Hz`
  - `8 V / 50 Hz` *(target for suppression)*
- These were **summed using an op-amp adder** circuit.
- The resulting composite signal was then passed through a twin T **passive notch filter**, consisting of:
  - A **low-pass filter** and a **high-pass filter**, each implemented using op-amps to create the notch filter behaviour
  - Their outputs were fed into another **op-amp adder** to add up the waveforms from the two filters
- The **output gain** of the final adder stage can be fine-tuned by adjusting resistor values to prevent amplitude clipping or excessive attenuation.

## Results

- The **FFT analysis** (performed using LTSpiceâ€™s built-in FFT tool) confirms:
  - **124 Hz** and **83 Hz** components remain intact
  - The **50 Hz component** is **attenuated by approximately 12â€¯dB**
- This validates the effective band-rejection behavior of the active notch configuration, specifically tuned for 50 Hz interference.
